* I am very new to all of this so what i would mainly like to focus on is just the basics so i can at least have somewhat of a foundation of knowlege behind coding before i start getting into the actual learning side of all of this. i do feel i have a bit of a learing curve from most of the students as most seem they know the basics of all of it. I do have alot of intrest in coding and see it being super useful for a future job espiecally the way things are expanding in calgary for technology.
* this is my first journal
