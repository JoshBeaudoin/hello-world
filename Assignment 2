Amazon:
Call-For-Action: Amazon has one very intreseting call for action which would be "Buy Again" which is just a button that brings you to everything you have purchased before. I think its a very good idea especially for small buisness owners who constantly are buying the same products off amazon for their buinesses and also helps amazon run buinesses keep the same consistant customers which means you will get same quaility and price everytime not just  guessing game on when it comes.\
The target audience for amazon is busy people who cant find time to get out during the day, it gives them easy accsess to home delivery so whatever they need is waiting for them when they get home.
I think that all of amazons call to actions have been very smartly set up for the way its used, for example the second you open the app you see a whole bar of call to action buttons all have a very specific but useful action to them like electronics or groceries. The only actions they are asking users to preform is to click the specific button to go buy specific items from them so really the call-to-actions are all just tp spend your money on their products. I think that amazon has a really good colour contrast to it, all the colours are kind of duller verisons of the regular colours which makes the website look less kid like and more buiness like. I think that amazon has a good size and scale to the website you dont seem to make things smaller when making the webpage smaller besides the actual web page itself which helps people who would need glasses and such to see. All imagies on amazon are obviously of products but each picture is a very high quailty image that doesnt look ike just some random is selling stuff online which makes it more likely for people to spend money there. All content on amazon is just what they are trying to sell to you theres really not much more to it.
